###Text editing training with highscores and instant replay

---

A lot of daily tasks require you to edit text. And if you use an editor like Notepad(++), Word, Sublime, Eclipse etc. or just type am email or a post on facebook, reddit or stackoverflow in your browser, the basic default keyboard shortcuts are the same. And knowing them can [save you precious time](http://lifehacker.com/5970089/back-to-the-basics-learn-to-use-keyboard-shortcuts-like-a-ninja).
But real efficiency is not reached by [just memorizing all shortcuts](https://www.shortcutfoo.com). It is also important (and fun!) to be able to effortlessly choose the tactics with the smallest amount of shortcuts to reach the desired goal.
EditGym.com helps you acquire this set of skills.
