Replicate the word.
If you do not yet know how, my suggestion is as follows:
- Select the first word by pressing shift + end arrow.
- Copy it to your clipboard by pressing ctrl + c.
- Press right to discard the selection.
- Insert a space character by pressing the space bar.
- Insert what you have in your clipboard with ctrl + v.
But of course, you can develop your own style.
Only using the mouse or holding down a key to produce multiple actions is against our gym rules.
