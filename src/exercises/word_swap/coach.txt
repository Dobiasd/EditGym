Swap the two words. My suggestion is as follows:
- Select the first word by pressing shift + ctrl + right arrow.
- Cut it by pressing ctrl + x.
- Remove the space by pressing the delete key.
- Navigate the cursor to the end by pressing the end key.
- Insert a space character by pressing the space bar.
- Insert what you have in your clipboard with ctrl + v.
But of course, you can develop your own style.
Only using the mouse or holding down a key to produce multiple
actions is against our gym rules.
