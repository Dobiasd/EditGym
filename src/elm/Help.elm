# Introduction
After choosing a [level](?page=levels) your goal is to get the content of the editor window to match the content of the goal window by editing the text.
The number of key movements (up *and* down) is counted and there is also a stop watch.
When you completed a level you will see how good you were compared to other users and to create highscrore entries if you wish.
To achieve a good score you will need to be efficient at using some simple keyboard shortcuts.

# Shortcuts

## Move cursor
* arrow key left - move cursor left
* arrow key right - move cursor right
* arrow key up - move cursor one line up
* arrow key down - move cursor one line down
* ctrl+left - move cursor one word to the left
* ctrl+right - move cursor one word to the right
* pos1 - move cursor to beginning of line
* end - move cursor to end of line
* ctrl+pos1 - move cursor to beginning of document
* ctrl+end - move cursor to end of document

## Copy and paste
* ctrl+c or ctrl+insert - copy selected text
* ctrl+x or shift+delete - cut selected text
* ctrl+v or shift+insert - paste text from clipboard to cursor/selection

## Deleting
* ctrl+backspace - delete previous word
* ctrl+delete - delete next word
* ctrl+shift+backspace - delete current line to cursor
* ctrl+delete - delete current line from cursor on

## Selecting
* shift+any cursor movement - select text

### Examples
* shift+right - select character to the right
* shift+down - move one line down and select all skipped characters
* shift+end - select current line up to cursor
* shift+ctrl+right - select word to the right
* shift+ctrl+end - select everything starting at cursor position

## Typing
Of course you also can just type in the required text, but in most cases this is not the most efficient way.


Now go and [work out your skills](?page=levels). :)
